# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
Kickstarter campaign analysis using Excel


## Conclusions
1.	Across all countries in which Kickstarter campaigns have been created, the categories of theater, music, and film & video are Kickstarter’s “bread and butter” in terms of greatest number of campaigns overall (2,613 out of 4,114 globally; accounting for 64% of the total) and greatest number of successful campaigns (1,675 out of 2,185 globally; a 77% success rate). Combined these three categories had a 64% success rate compared to a 34% success rate across the remaining categories (food, games, journalism, photography, publishing, and technology) and a 53% success rate across all categories.
2.	Within the category of theater (1,393 campaigns), the subcategory of plays has the most volume with 1,066 campaigns, compared to musical (140 campaigns) and spaces (187 campaigns). Plays are also the most successful subcategory with a 65% success rate compared to musical (39% success rate) and spaces (46% success rate). Although the subcategory plays has a lower success rate than other subcategories (see below), it should continue to be a focus for marketing engagement due to its comparatively high volume.
3.	Within the category of film & video (520 campaigns), the subcategory of documentary has the most volume at 180 campaigns and a 100% success rate, indicating that documentary should be a continued focus for marketing engagement. The subcategories of shorts (60 campaigns) and television (60 campaigns), both with a 100% success rate, could be targets for greater activation.
4.	Within the category of music (700 campaigns), the subcategory of rock has the most volume (260 campaigns) and a 100% success rate, indicating that rock should be a continued focus for marketing engagement. Classical music, electronic music, and pop (each with 40 campaigns and a 100% success rates), could be targets for greater activation.
